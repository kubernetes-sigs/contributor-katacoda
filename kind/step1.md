[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool built for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes. Kind was intended primarily for testing Kubernetes itself, but it's actually quite useful for setting up a Kubernetes environment for local development, QA, or continuous integration and deployment.
